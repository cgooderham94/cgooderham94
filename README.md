- 👋 Hi, I’m @cgooderham94, Senior Front-end Developer and budding tech leader!
- 👀 I’m interested in all things front-end development with a passion for building UX-focussed UI's with an emphasis on scalable architecture, accessibility and performance.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react ⚛️ and react hooks ⚛️🪝 with a view to work commercially with it this year!
- 🗨️ “Learning is a lifelong process of keeping abreast of change. And the most pressing task is to teach people how to learn.”
- 💻 You'll mostly see my self-learning and freelance adventures here, but I'd love to chat more about my experience, interests and what I build and get up to in my day-to-day role!
- 📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn 👉🏽 https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-gooderham/
